<h4><strong>Team Composition</strong></h4>
<p>
    The breakdown of our teams’ personalities and tendencies will be a significant help in the smooth operation of the IT Mob.
    With the ability for each person to understand where the others are coming from, especially in this type of group work with limited contact and none face-to-face, any added information is helpful in reducing conflict and misunderstandings.
    Our team has a particularly good spread of personalities with very few clashes, and this will be an asset to our performance.
    Along with a few leadership type personalities we also contain an analytical-type architect and three mediator/emotional based personality type to keep the group running smoothly. 
</p>

<p>
    Our group also has a wide range of learning styles, this is an especially advantageous in the circumstances we are currently under as the variation in effective styles will allow our group to attain as much information as possible. 
</p>

<h2><strong> Group Processes </strong> </h2>
<p>
    Below is an excerpt from the group reflection of our, the IT Mob’s, assessment two. 
</p>

<p>
    “Rarely do you see a group of six strangers mesh together so perfectly. The strong points outlined are consistent within everyone's reflections – communication, collaboration, willingness to help, willingness to share knowledge, and ability to agree on and complete an evenly shared workload.
    Realistically these traits would be the listed dot points of an ideal team player, and each member has ticked off every item.
    Throughout assignment 2 the IT Mob has come together on nearly every aspect of this assignment, whether it be through helping with proofreading, discussing document layouts, assisting with information collection, or correcting people’s referencing.
    As Angadh stated in his reflection - “Work was distributed equally according to individual's strengths which allowed for smooth workflow and dynamic collaboration between group members”, and this holds true not only for assignment sections but also covering each other's shortfalls in certain areas.  
</p>

<p>
    Every single member found the above points surprising, and we hope we get to work together in the future. It’s also worth noting that while collaboration and assistance was given, everyone made incredible progress into their assigned sections before anyone else saw it.” 
</p>

<p>
    Upon reflection, our assessment of assignment two remains as it was upon completion. This is not to say the process we implemented were perfect, some of the notes for improvement raised by the group in the reflection again, are as follows. 
</p>

<p>
    “The improvements listed in our individual reflections were minor, and everyone picked up on different aspects that could be improved. These included time management, sharing work earlier and improving on skills and knowledge.
    All these improvements will be made naturally throughout our participation in this course and careers, and for our first group assignment, we believe the improvements to be minor and expected.”
</p>

<p>
    Other improvements raised by group members that are to be implemented are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Better management of proof reading by team members specifically assigned this task. </li>
    <li>Keeping better track of tasks assigned to team members and implementing a task management system or program. </li>
    <li>Uploading of work as it is completed rather than a single block at the due date. </li>
</ul>

<p>
    By reflection upon our processes and their success or failure, we feel confident that we will be better placed in this Assignment 3. While incredibly pleased with our team's communication and work through the previous weeks, there are areas we would like to improve, and will implement the above improvement to benefit our performance going forward. 
</p>

<h2><strong> Career Plans </strong> </h2>
<h4><strong>Angadh Bazaad</strong></h4>
<p>
    My career choice has remained as is, In the future technology will only continue to advance which will require teams to collaborate and work together to produce constant advancements.
    The need for teamwork will always make the position of project manager increasingly relevant. To reach my goal, I will finish my Bachelors in IT first through RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology).
    During my studies I plan to apply for junior entry level positions to gain experience in several IT fields. After completing my undergraduate bachelor's degree, I plan to pursue a Post Graduate Diploma in Project Management or MBA (Master of Business Administration) in Project Management.
    After completing this I will gain the work experience needed in related roles. After 2-3 years' experience, I plan to secure my job as an IT project manager.
</p>

<h4><strong>Matthew Bradley</strong></h4>
<p>
    I will continue towards my ideal career of becoming a software engineer. The first step will be to complete my university study, then once completed I will apply for a junior programming job if available.
    This is when I will start my study in programming/ development. I believe that this will be a more realistic way to develop my knowledge whilst gaining experience.
    I believe there will be many years spent around this level of employment, to gain knowledge on other aspects that will be required for me to progress to the end goal of a software engineer. 
</p>

<h4><strong>Maddison Davis</strong></h4>
<p>
    My ideal career in IT is still the same as before, robotics. After completing this course, the path I will take will be getting a job within IT being an IT technician this will help me understand the basics and gain experience, whilst still being able to study more to pursue a role in the robotic field.
    After some research, I understand one of the major fields I need to study is engineering, skills I should practice are math, science, programming, working in a team, solving complex problems, thinking creatively, and active listening (Eastwood, B 2020).
    So, I will start working on these once finished ‘Introduction to Information and Technology.’ Another option I could take a looking into trainee positions. 
</p>

<h4><strong>Cameron McNab</strong></h4>
<p>
    My chosen career as a Software Engineer/Developer is still the goal. My overall plan is to use my results from the RMIT intro courses to enter a Bachelor of IT - Computer Science degree at the local university of QUT (Queensland University of Technology).
    Attending QUT will provide me with local contacts, career options and the ability to go to in-person exams and lectures. Once completed I plan to work entry level positions to gain knowledge and instruction, then move to remote work in a small team developing helpful and useful client applications.
    After this I will have advanced far enough in my career and knowledge to work wherever and on whatever I wish.
</p>

<h4><strong>Beau Foster</strong></h4>
<p>
    My ideal job as a software architect has not changed at this point. To achieve this goal, I will complete my bachelor's degree in information technology and then aim to get a job as a software developer.
    After spending some time in the industry and working my way to a senior developer, I will broaden my knowledge through different short courses that focus on software development. From here I will be able to move towards a role as a Technical Lead or an Associate Architect.
    The goal of being a software architect is ambitious, but I believe that if I keep focused on my goals then I will be able to achieve them. 
</p>

<h4><strong>Kieran Symons</strong></h4>
<p>
    My career plans remain consistent with my ideal job. After completing my Electrical A-Grade, then finishing the Bachelor of IT for which this course is a part, I will look to take on roles in Network administration and design.
    After being part of this workspace for a time to gain the knowledge and experience required to operate my own business; consulting, design, and installation of integrated networks for domestic, commercial and industrial uses.
    This course has influenced my thoughts on the way I will operate my business and after conversations with classmates and professionals, there is a significant opportunity in the centering of user experience in the way our structures are designed. It is in this space I will aim from here.

    <h3><strong>Conclusion </strong></h3>
    <p>
        Our group has a diverse range of career aspirations. Many of the job roles contain similarities and many differences.
        The largest intersections in our jobs are the requirement for tertiary study with an allowable amount of industry experience as a substitute, and the need to be fluent in general computer related skills and applications as is to be expected.
        There is a large projected job growth across most of our jobs, with salaries that are all above the national average.
        The highlighted jobs of our group are quite different in their paths, several are management roles, several are technical roles, several are engineering while others are development. Overall, our groups interests are as widely varied as the members within it.

        In the discussion around our career plans, there is a sense of maturity in how we look at the industry compared to how we saw it before this course, Introduction to IT.
        The common theme amongst the plans outlined is the need for experience, competence, and a broad knowledge of the industry.
        It has become clear to all of us that the IT industry inherently requires its professionals to be able to learn and adapt to projects that include several different disciplines included, from a software architect requiring knowledge of skills such as programming through to business management  and project development, to a mechatronic engineer whose skills need to include programming,  science and creative problem solving.
        This aspect of the IT sphere is endemic, with the industry changing and evolving as fast as it is, being able to adapt and have broad ranging skills is necessary for a career in IT.
