                                                    <h5>What aspects of the position is most challenging?</h5>


<p>
    We endeavored to find out what Mr. Bazaad felt was the most challenging aspects of his role as a project manager were. His answer was immediate, “the biggest mistake is, you know, when you don’t [stay] locked on the scope.” Mr. Bazaad felt that in his experience “salespeople … rush to sign off the deal, make it happen and if you missed the nitty gritty of that [deal] then you can get bogged down…, you don’t have clear requirements. You don’t have the clear scope. The goal post keeps moving.” This problem faced by many projects can cause issues to “the timeline, the budget, everything.” This is significant insight especially with our groups ongoing work in these assignments, where we are attempting to provide a tangible project idea with associated artifacts, in assessment three. Limiting the scope of our ambitions will lend a big hand to our project. Thankfully Mr. Bazaad supplied us with his trademark process for dealing with the issue of scope, a process he referred to as “the [four’ W’s and H”.    
    </p>
<p>
    “What needs to be delivered? Why we need to deliver it? Who’s [going] to deliver it? When it’s going to be delivered? And then how? So, these are the core. If you answer all these, you are the project manager.” 
    </p>
<p>
    Earlier in the interview in response to another question, Mr. Bazaad touched on another aspect of his various roles in project management he found rewarding and challenging. “There’s a human aspect, plays a big part in the project management”. What he is referring to is the challenges of working multi-nationally with many varying teams, and the challenges involved in overcoming “cultural background difference[s]” and “different linguistic skills”. Especially when it comes to motivation. Part of his earned experience is knowing how to get the best from people. Mr. Bazaad explained it like this. “Sometimes you gotta be hard, you know you gotta take out the whip as well. For people [who are not] performing but you need to … manage in a subtle way.” 
    </p>

                                                    <h5>Where do you see the IT Industry moving? </h5>

<p>Mr. Bazaad stated that he feels that “IT is always evolving. You know if somebody thinks whatever you learn now will last with you the rest of life then you’re kidding yourself.” He believes that “most of the new technological advancement is in artificial intelligence…”. He points to examples such as the behavioral algorithms in place at social media networks and his own work in automation that will lead to the use of artificial intelligence as his evidence for this belief. We asked how he feels about this change and whether there will be any impact on his role as a project manager. In his usual quick manner, he let us in on his secret. “Someone has to implement it, right? Somebody has to code that. Someone has to test it.” Mr. Bazaad expanded on his point above about the need for ICT professionals to be constantly evolving with the technology, he admits “…I will have to upgrade myself with it.” And “Some other things underneath [change], like you know, but you just upskill yourself.” This was a common theme amongst the entire interview with Mr. Bazaad, he frequently emphasized how important it is that we, as prospective IT professionals, never let ourselves become obsolete, we should always be learning and upskilling with the new technologies.
     </p>
<p>
    “If I become stagnant then I won't be across the new technology, so I read through a lot of the technology papers that come out to read about what their technology is. When I go into the organization, I read about the, you know, the architecture there of the system, what is their read about the processes mapping and all that. So, these things you have to be to read it as a part of the project manager.”  
    </p>
                                                     <h5>Any advice for future IT professionals  </h5>

<p>
    Mr. Bazaad had some insightful advice for future IT professionals, he is a firm believer that the industry is so wide, that there is a place for any and everyone. He gave this example “You know you are being taught the basic. You're being given the base of the IT. You know you're being taught the fundamentals of programming as well. And what you'll find out is some of you may not have neck for the programming. OK, so that does not mean you got no career in IT. Not everyone who's doing it becomes a programmer.” He touched on several other important roles in the IT industry that are unrelated to pure programming such as a business analyst, “They are critical to the project because they are a bridge between a business and the right people.”, testers, project managers, support, and operations. Mr. Bazaad gave us some final advice on how to approach our education: 
    </p>

    <p>
        “There's opportunities are endless, so go through your degree, see where your interest lies and then sort of move more into you know making yourself more expert into that… and see how you go.” 
         </p>
    
    <p>
        This sort of advice is extremely beneficial to beginners in the IT world as indeed, the scope of it is daunting, but with such large scope does come many possibilities, and confirmation that it can take time to find your niche is welcome.
