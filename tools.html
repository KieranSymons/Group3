                        <h1>Tools</h1>
<h5>Actions Taken</h5>
<p>To start our group collaboration, communication tools were set up. Team leader Kieran created a Canvas group, MS team, and GitHub group repository. All were used extensively:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Canvas Group: this was used as a first contact tool to get all members into the MS teams and GitHub group repository as student IDs were needed.</li>
  <li>MS teams: this was the preferred way to communicate as it has a group chat option, individual chats, a video meeting tool, and a channel system in which to store/separate our content. The whole team interacted with the tool often and efficiently, creating reports for each section which were shared through uploading files to the assignment two-channel. The group could also post reports with comments to show all members the progress in the assigned sections. Kieran kept all our work organized in folders and the filename was suffixed incomplete or complete to allow easy recognition of the section status. This small thing enabled the team members assigned to the website to upload and format the information, aware of which were finished, and which were in progress.</li>
  <li>GitHub: When using GitHub two members were assigned this role to start designing the layout, uploading the report contents, and styling of the website, whilst other members of the group were assigned to create the content to go on the website. GitHub commit, push and pull commands was used throughout the whole process of designing the website to share work with each member of the group, whilst explaining in the description the changes that had been made so it was effectively communicated on what changes were made, this reflects in the commit trail. MS teams chat and video was used by the team in order to share information, changes, and thoughts we had on the website, the team would brainstorm together during this time to make contributions toward the design of the website, also any issues were communicated here and resolved as a team through discussion, GitHub commit trial does not reflect this work.</li>
</ul>
