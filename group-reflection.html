    <h5>Individual Reflection</h5>

    <p>Throughout this project my team has been extremely strong in setting and executing tasks as well as communicating ideas. From the start our team leader Kieran was fast to set schedules for us to follow, all our members are super active and have similar mindsets, so we were able to get development of our project idea underway fast. Work was distributed equally according to individual's strengths which allowed for smooth workflow and dynamic collaboration between group members. We have had no conflicts within our group throughout the project, it has flowed seamlessly in all stages. The thing I found most surprising was the wide range of skills and knowledge each member brought to the group, this allowed us to really build and collaborate on each other's ideas. Something I feel I could have planned for better was time management throughout the Christmas and new year's period. Other than this it has been extremely easy to collaborate with my group members, having active members that constantly interact and update allows me to set schedules and keep track of deadlines to get my tasks done effectively and on time. We had meetings twice a week, which was great to see where everyone was at and if they needed help with anything. We also communicated through MS teams' message with small updates throughout development which kept all members on top of everything. It has been a pleasure to work and collaborate with all members of my group. </p>

    <p>Overall, I believe our group has worked extremely well together. At the beginning we all came together through Umera’s weekly webinar, and Matthew joined us slightly later. As a group we were able to meet early and begin sharing our project ideas and discussing our approach for the assessment. Together we were able to discuss and decide on the project idea we wished to collaborate on, along with assigning the workload. Everybody was able to work together and produce a result. Kieran has done an amazing job as chairperson for our meetings, with Maddison stepping up during his absence. </p>
    <p>I was surprised that we have been able to work together so effectively without any conflict. Our entire group has done an amazing job and pulled their weight. Although Matthew joined our group late, he did an amazing job catching up on what we had done so far and figured out the areas that we had not yet started and jumped straight in to fill the gap.</p>
    <p>Through this group I have learnt that through good communication and understanding of each other's strengths, weaknesses, and personal situations, we are able to exceed our goals for this assessment, along with making friends.</p>
    <p>In terms of how we could have improved as a group, the only thing I could think of would be the sharing of unfinished work as it is done. My thoughts on this are to share what we have completed before we turn off the computer in case another member might be active and could proofread. This could benefit us in the long run as proof reading could be done iteratively instead of on a larger scale at the end where small mistakes may be missed.</p>

    <p>My opinion on this group is that everyone has contributed evenly, been very engaged in communicating with one another, and every member is willing to help one another. All decisions in the group were handled extremely maturely and I found there were no high levels of confrontation, if there was a disagreement the group would discuss their options and come to a decision together. On my own account, I believe I could have worked better by printing out the assessment, highlighting the section each individual member was doing, and marking completed sections along the way. Towards the end, I needed to regroup and check which areas were completed and which areas were not. I did not do this along the way, and I saw I had missed a small part of my work which I then needed to backtrack and complete.  </p>
    <p>What surprised me is how well the group got along and how well we all work together for our first assessment. I found no problems between members of the group; everyone was very helpful and willing to work. I have learnt many things from this group, assistance with using GitHub, referencing methods, broader knowledge on technology applications available to us, and skills in work with a team e.g., communication methods and signing work as complete or incomplete to advise team members where you’re up too.  </p>
    <h5>Matthew Bradley</h5>
    <p>The two most important parts of any team are attendance and communication and I believe that IT mob showed high efficacy in this from the very start. All members of the team showed an amazing effort, with most members attending every meeting, even during the Christmas period. I believe that the weight of this assignment has been carried out equally by everyone involved. Upon reflection some improvement could be made; one aspect I will change for future team assignments is to not only assign individual tasks to team members but also one separate person the task of proofreading and assisting on these tasks, once completed.  </p>
    <p>I found it surprising how easily six people who had never met before came together so quickly and made a start. Communication in this project was going to be key from the very beginning. With everyone being heard team members were able to show what sections of the assignment work to their strengths and ask for assistance in areas that weren’t their strongest. I was also very surprised with how  easy Github is to navigate once we dove in.  Groups can be great if managed correctly but if ill-managed can become very unproductive, so one very important take from this assignment has been just how important communication really is, Team members will always make the best decision when provided with all the information. Overall, very pleased with how the team was led and organized and kept on track    </p>
    <h5>Kieran Symons</h5>
    <p>This group has been remarkably active, everyone has contributed immensely, even the members who joined later in the timeline. It is a testament to the quality of the people we have in this group, that members have been able to fit extremely well into roles that suit them and play to their strengths. As team leader I believe I could have handled the flow of work better to have sections completed earlier in the project timeline, however we have managed to pull everything together without any freeloaders and there is not too much I would change about our entire process. I have found the collaborative and selfless nature of our entire team to be a surprise, with so many people from many backgrounds all working via online meetings, this was something I did not expect. You would not think that a group of 6 randomly connected people would be able to have the maturity and skillsets to complete a research and collaboration task with minimal conflict. It has become obvious through this that the key to avoiding any misunderstandings or letting things slack is an abundance of communication from all members, and not one singular voice carrying all the weight, and video (face-to-face) meetings which can overcome misunderstandings through the lack of conversational tone in text.</p>
