    <li>Website production – None of our chosen jobs explicitly require website production </li>

<strong>Three Highest Not-Required Baseline Skills from Burning Glass “Greatest Demand (Baseline Skills)” </strong>
<ol>
<li>English – May be a presumed pre-requisite or discovered during interview stage </li>
<li>Articulate – May be a presumed pre-requisite or inferable through portfolio </li>
<li>Self-starter – May be a presumed pre-requisite or not required for some of our more entry level positions </li>
</ol>

</p>

                            <h5><strong>Opinions On Data</strong></h5>

<p>
    Given the industry data discussed earlier, the following is a statement from each group member stating why their chosen ideal job has or hasn’t been influenced by that information. 
</p>

<p><strong>Angadh - </strong>My personal career choice has not been affected much by the data presented. No matter what direction IT moves in collaboration and teamwork will always be needed to develop and create modern technologies. While this is required my ideal job will always be relevant. The best thing about this path is it has many similar positions such as project delivery head that are easily adaptable with the same skill base as mentioned by our IT interviewee. The data shows how the skills are Widley applicable, and this is extremely useful in terms of wanting to adapt with the evolution of IT. 


</p>

<p><strong>Beau - </strong>After reading through the data from Burning Glass my ideal job has not changed. Looking through both the required skills and baseline skills that my ideal job requires has given me greater insight into the role, and I find myself excited for the challenges that await.</p>
<p>I have a few of the baseline skills required as indicated by Burning Glass, but this data has also given me the knowledge of key areas that I must focus on and improve. In the future, I may see a change in what my ideal job will look like, but I believe that my ideal job will always be based on positions that are similar.</p>  


<p><strong>Cameron - </strong>
My opinion regarding my ideal job has not changed, I will still be aiming for a similar skillset and position in the future. Every listed skill has been ranked relatively highly and seems very transferrable and in high demand, leading to a multitude of career changes and opportunities in the future without the need to change industries. 
</p>
<p>
The baseline skills data further reinforced my drive for a similar position. The lack of required leadership, management, and business involvement sounds ideal for myself as I prefer to follow as opposed to lead. If, however, my opinions surrounding my work change, this position will still allow me to gain the skills and knowledge required to step into a leadership role moving forward. 
</p>
<p><strong>Kieran -</strong>
    My opinion has not been swayed in any way by the information source from Burning Glass. The spotlight place on many of the important skills listed high in the data set only encourage me to peruse this skillset more aggressively. Many of the skill are helpful in their own right across many sectors and jobs not just my aimed path. 
</p>
<p>
    Much of what I want to achieve in my future career encourages and even requires these skills, it is well that they are placed with such importance in the IT sphere.     
</p>
<p><strong>Maddison -</strong>
    I have not changed my ideal job; I just have a great understanding now in which areas I need to push myself to study in. I am a great believer in doing a job you are passionate and interested in so I will still be aiming to succeed in this work field. 

    I currently have some of the skills listed, in the role I am in now, so I will look at focusing on the other listed items to gain a better insight and to learn more about them. 
</p>
<p><strong>Matthew -</strong>
After gathering this data from the burning glass study done in 2018, it has only pushed me further into the direction of a software engineer, with the knowledge of SQL being highly sort after and a necessary skill for this profession, t bis the number 1 skill in demand, Once this skill is obtained through study I feel as I will have many more possibilities will become available for me in my career.     
</p>
<p>
As problem-solving is a strength of mine, software engineering is a very sustainable option for myself and my personality. Facing many complex problems daily, with the satisfaction gained from overcoming these issues, the position also requires excellent communication is a skill set I will need to improve on in the hope of retaining the job. I believe I have found a career path that suits my personality with the challenges of it being possible to overcome
