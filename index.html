<p>   
  The breakdown of our teams’ personalities and tendencies will be a great help in the smooth operation of the IT Mob. With the ability for each person to understand where the others are coming from, especially in this type of group work with limited contact and none face-to-face, any added information is helpful in reducing conflict and misunderstandings. Our team has a very good spread of personalities with very few clashes, and this will be an asset to our performance. Along with a few leadership type personalities we also contain  an analytical-type architect and three mediator/emotional based personality type to keep the group running smoothly. 

  Our group also has a wide range of learning styles, this is a especially advantageous in the circumstances we are currently under as the variation in effective styles will allow our group to attain as much information as possible.

</li>
  <li>While most roles do require some programming experience, the roles of Network engineer and project manager do not explicitly state its necessity (Seek 2021). </li>
</ul>
