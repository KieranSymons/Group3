        <br>Myself and angadh were assigned the task to come up with a game for the application. We both had great communication, having a constant chat through MS teams made this very easy. We set our selves little manageable tasks daily or weekly. For example week two has to research a software platform we can use, week two was to decide what style of game we would build. Our time was managed very well through this system, The team also provided great feedback and support through ideas and suggestions and later in the project testing. Midway through this section I fell ill through covid. Angadh was able to pick up my share of work for this time making this time a lot easier on myself. One element I could improve on is attention to detail while designing games also I have learnt that game development takes a lot of time and persistence. But I believe that the whole team really pulled together to finish this assignment’s together.

        <br> I believe as a group we did well together, there was more pressure due to more than one assessment needing to be submitted by the 20th of February. I think all of us found this a bit challenging, but I was surprised and learnt that everyone worked quiet well together under pressure. We are working a lot close to the end submission time where before we had space to breathe. Still even with this pressure everyone has been willing to get in and get the work done. The team is also offering to help each other with a positive attitude which was good. I do not necessary think this is wrong, but I do believe a separate video meeting for A5 instead of doing it together with our normal meetings for A3 could have been helpful, I think doing it all in one big meeting has the potential to miss communication or missing out information which was important. I could improve in future with becoming more familiar in being a lead, there is room to improve here but I do also see it is confidence issue that is letting me down so the more I do group assessments the more comfortable I will become in being a leader in the future to be able to support the team.

        <br>This Project was planned and executed well, the choice to develop a game for the app was super fun and at first scary when presented to me but I was keen to learn and give it a go due to my interests in games. I had the pleasure of collaborating with Mathew this project, which was great, we had constant contact daily with regular updates on the game Development at all stages. When tackling the development of the app Mathew and myself were faced with many challenges in the beginning as we both have no experience in game making. The constant contact through MS teams allowed for us to learn together and share which software would be best to use. As usual our team held meetings twice a week on MS teams, all members are positive and attend meetings to best of their abilities. The team is incredibly supportive in taking on roles when needed to help others when needed. Having so many Assessments due at once disturbed my timeline personally, to improve many of the smaller assessments should have been done maybe abit earlier.

        <br>As a group I feel there was a noticeable difference between this assessment and assessment 2. Coming away from the Christmas break and some of us returning to a busier than normal work schedule, we could feel the strain. With that being said, we managed to keep up our communications on Microsoft Teams consistent while still holding meetings twice weekly with everyone giving progress updates on their sections and conveying any concerns or problems they are experiencing (This can be seen in our Microsoft Teams meeting logs and transcriptions. We decided to split the work between pairs for this assessment with Kieran and myself working on the website, Maddison and Cameron working on the user interface, and Angadh and Matthew working on the game development. As the deadline began to creep, we could all feel the pressure but were able to kick it up a gear to push out as much content as possible. I found it surprising how six people who have never met each other before are able to go through this process smoothly and efficiently without conflict arising. With everyone working well together and supporting anyone that needed assistance, this group has shown me how a good team is able to overcome any obstacle.

        As a group we have all contributed, none has been distance or not wanting to work. Everybody has bought their positive and helpful attitudes along to each meeting with a mindset of wanting to take on work to help to push the team toward the finish line. The assessment was given out in sections for all to complete which everyone held up to doing so, communicate between the team has been efficient and consistent through Microsoft teams chat and video meetings, the team is always updating each other on states of their work process. 
        </p>
       <p>
        As a team we all work very well together, there has been no disagreements or disputes between team members. All decision making has been done through an open discussion or brainstorming process, so everybody has been able to have a say and all thoughts were taken on by the team with everyone feel able to speak freely of their ideas with no judgement. “No idea is a bad idea”.  
       </p>
       <p>
        What could be improved, we have all faced a challenging journey this time around as a group due to having more than one assessment each to submit, plus some of us are doing two class not only one, but our completion of the assessment has also been much close to the due date which has taught us all more about balancing and jugging multiple tasks and how hard that can be. We are all still learning in this area and could do a little more time management skill development to hopefully be as successful with time as we were in assessment three.   
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing that was surprising to the team was how well we all worked under pressure, none became frustrated toward others with the pressure, everyone was still extremely positive and willing to help each other. This was extremely good because things could have gone wrong if someone became to overwhelmed with the workload. The support between team members has been incredibly good.    
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, everyone has done a smashing job and work extremely hard to do the best they could. We are all happy with everyone contributions and team effort they dedicated toward the IT MOB we have had a wonderful time working together, many laughs and new friends have been made in this group. It is sad thinking this is our last week together, but we are all excited for the future and what it brings us.
