                                                      <h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies </h1>

<h5><strong> What does it do </strong> </h5>
<p>     
Blockchain technology first came about in 1991, where Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta described a cryptographically secured chain of blocks with the hope to implement a system where document time stamps could not be tampered with.<span class="references"> (ICAEW, 2019) </span>
</p>    
<p>
Blockchain, which is the technology at the heart of all cryptocurrencies, is a database that stores information electronically by collecting it in groups known as blocks. These blocks have certain storage capacities and, when these capacities have been reached, the block is closed off and linked to its parent block through the use of cryptography.
</p>
<p>
<span class="references2"> Figure 1, How does a transaction get into the blockchain, Euromoney Learning, 2020</span> 
One of the biggest differences between blockchain databases and normal databases is the way of structuring data into blocks instead of tables. This data structure creates a timeline of data that is irreversible, permanent, and transparent. <span class="references">(Hayes, A, 2022)</span>
</p>
<p> 
As blockchain technology is permanent and irreversible, it has become the foundation of ledgers used by cryptocurrencies to record transactions between two parties efficiently, and in a verifiable way. Due to the transparency of the blockchain, along with the ledger being stored across a vast number of nodes through the use of peer-to-peer networking, cryptocurrency has become a safe and cheap alternative for transactions world wide.<span class="references"> (Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017) </span> 
</p>
<p>
Most people think of cryptocurrency when blockchain is mentioned, and that’s understandable, with almost 10,000 cryptocurrencies running on blockchain.<span class="references"> (Fusion Media Ltd, 2022) </span> Blockchain technology is extremely versatile and is not bound by storing monetary transactions.  Multiple companies across the globe have incorporated blockchain technology into their businesses, from Walmart to Pfizer, to IBM

</p> 
<p>
    <span class="references">. (Hayes, A, 2022) </span> A perfect example of this is IBM created a Food Trust blockchain which traces the journey of their food products to their final destination. This gives IBM the ability to trace the products entire journey back to its origin if a potential contamination has occured, allowing for the cause of the contamination to be found much quicker and more reliably then if the company had to go through the records manually.

        Cryptocurrency has been growing in popularity over the last few years due to an increase in media coverage, the idea of the currency not being regulated by government bodies, and a perception that people will be missing out on the next big thing. Although there has been a large influx of people entering the cryptocurrency space, some do not understand what they are getting involved in. Cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital token that is based on blockchain technology. Many people are familiar with the popular tokens such as bitcoin, ethereum, xrp, and dogecoin, but do not understand the use behind the tokens. 
</p>
<p>
        Tokens such as dogecoin were originally created as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies at the time, whereas tokens such as xrp, bitcoin and ethereum were created with a purpose in mind.<span class="references" >(Frankenfield. J, 2021) </span> was created by the US-based company Ripple Labs Inc, which allows financial institutions to transfer money with greatly reduced fees and wait times. There are many different tokens in the cryptocurrency space with a multitude of uses.    
</p>
<p>
        Ripple, unlike other cryptocurrencies, does not use blockchain technology, but instead uses a “hash tree”, also known as a “Merkle Tree”. This system is similar to the blockchains used by other cryptocurrencies, although instead of using a proof of work system similar to Bitcoin, it uses a consensus based model. Due to this difference, the Ripple network is able to process a much larger number of transactions per second. So far Ripple has managed to sign up over 100 banks to use their infrastructure. (Ahmad. N, 2021)

        Blockchain technology has the ability to be utilised across all industries with multiple applications. These applications could be used in securing patient informatio  n across the healthcare industry, providing smart contracts between tenants and landlords, and becoming more widely implemented across different supply chains.  (Reiff. N, 26 July 2021)  

        As this technology is only just beginning to be implemented across a range of industries, I believe that the extent this technology can be utilised is still unclear. 
</p>
<h5><strong> What is the Likely Impact  </strong> </h5>    

<p> Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are going to have a large impact across multiple industries in the future. As development of blockchain technology continues, we are likely to see drastic changes to how companies store and monitor their data. With the implementation of these changes, we are likely to see a much greater need for IT jobs that have specialties analysing, building, and troubleshooting these databases. 
</p>

<p>
    Due to the nature of blockchain, this could potentially put a strain on companies who wish to utilise this technology but are unable to acquire competent staff, do not have staff with an understanding of the technology, or are unable to move to the new technology due to financial reasons. Along with the need for competent staff, we could see a range of redundancies due to the nature of the blockchain. There is a larger potential for these systems to become automated in the future, reducing the manpower required to run them compared to older database systems.    
</p>

<p>
    Cryptocurrency could see a very different impact to blockchain technology, as these can be used as investments and assets for both individuals and companies. Due to the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency along with increased media attention, people may invest in crypto currency with the belief that they could make large amounts of money quickly. This can become problematic as it can create huge levels of stress amongst people due to its high volatility, and people may end up losing vast sums of money in the process if they invest without sufficient knowledge and strategy.    
</p>

<p>
    Although cryptocurrency has its cons, it also has its pros. With the large difference in fees and speeds of payments between parties, especially cross-border payments, cryptocurrency has the opportunity to drastically change the financial sector. Stable coins will have a large part in this, as they are tied to a fiat currency and can be easily changed back into a fiat currency of choice.    
</p>

<p>
    One of the largest downsides to cryptocurrency is how it is being used by criminal organisations to launder money. As there does not need to be any form of meeting before transferring cryptocurrency between wallets, and there is no mediator or middle-man, criminal organisations are able to deliver illicit services and receive payment much easier than in the past. This has become problematic for many countries, as it has become more difficult to track payments.
