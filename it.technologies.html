<h5><strong> What does it do </strong> </h5>
<p>Blockchain technology first came about in 1991, where Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta described a cryptographically secured chain of blocks with the hope to implement a system where document time stamps could not be tampered with. (ICAEW, 2019)
</p>    
<p>Blockchain, which is the technology at the heart of all cryptocurrencies, is a database that stores information electronically by collecting it in groups known as blocks. These blocks have certain storage capacities and, when these capacities have been reached, the block is closed off and linked to its parent block through the use of cryptography.

    <p>  
        There are a lot of fascinating developments going on in the IT world, many of which may fall by the wayside, but some of which
        are likely to change the way the world works. Historic examples of such developments include the Internet, smartphones, cloud
        computing and public-key cryptography.
        In this section you should report on 4 of the areas below.
        <ul>
        <li>Clouds, services, servers</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
        <li>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</li>
        <li> Robots</li>
        <li> Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</li>
    </ul>
        Some starting points and other information will be made available on Canvas.
        For each of the areas covered, you should report on the following.
