<h1>Project Plan </h1>

<h2><strong> Overview</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Topic</strong></h3>
<p>
    An overview of what you propose to do in your project. Concentrate on the big picture and outcomes, rather than
    intricate details. At least two paragraphs is expected.
</p>

<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
<p>
    What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with
current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is
expected.
</p>

<h3><strong>Landscape</strong></h3>
<p>
    What similar systems or products are available? What competitors are there? What points of difference are there
    about your project compared to what exist now? At least one paragraph is expected.
    
</p>

<h2><strong>Detailed Description</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Aims</strong></h3>
<p>
    Within this Project, there are key elements at the forefront of the idea as well and some smaller yet essential elements.
    The main objective for the IT Mob is to deliver critical information about what to recycle and just as important, what not to recycle, to people of all ages.
    This being the team’s main objective the next step is to provide a means to achieve this, the following questions were asked:  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How can we get this information across to people? </li>
    <li>hy would the younger/older generation open the information? </li>
    <li>Can we make recycling simpler in a specific local area?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the questions had been asked, the team started working on the answers. This idea can become a reality firstly through the use of an application.
    This application will have a simple layout containing all the relevant information about general recycling that can be done at home.
    The first step in this plan will be to conduct extensive research into the structure of recycling, due to the limited time available, this research will be done for one state in Australia.
    With further time given, more states will be included. Future development of this Application will involve a geotagged system where the users will be given the correct information based on where they are at the point of time the app is opened.
</p>
<p>
    A big issue that has been raised is why would people of all ages want to download our application.
    To address this concern, we came up with the idea of a mobile game designed to educate users through gameplay, as this has proven successful in many formats.
    Inside the game, the user will run down a road collecting recyclables gaining points. The user will lose a life when they try and collect a piece of rubbish that is non-recyclable. 
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the aim of this project is to create a platform on which information is easily and simply identifiable.
    This will be achieved through two main aspects, a mobile application, and a game. The teams first step will be in-depth research of the topic, then designing the application.
    After this will be the production of a game designed to educate the part of the population that are visual, tactile learners. If time allows the team will look further into integrating systems into the app that allow location-specific information easier to gather.
</p>

<h3><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></h3>
<p>
    Here you should give as much detail as you can about what your project will do, and how you will do it. This should also include
how far you have got with developing any features or outcomes from your project. Tell us about the “story" of your project –
how it began, how it has progressed, and what stage of the plan you are up to. Include any dead-ends you may have followed,
decisions made, and changes that have been made to the project plan. This will need to include a significant amount of detail,
so that it is easily seen what precisely you have done and are planning to do. If it helps, imagine the information that would be
required if you were to hand this project over at the end of the semester to a new team to complete the job. What would you
want to know, if you were one of the people taking over? There is no set length for this section, but it is hard to believe that less
than two pages could be adequate. Three or four pages is far more likely.
</p>

<h3><strong>Roles</strong></h3>
<p>
    The IT mob is a diverse group with different strengths to capitalise on. Within this team, all the members have naturally adapted to their roles with ease. The leader of the group, Kieran, was chosen as he has a keen eye for detail, making him a great decision-maker.
    Within the group, Angadh and Beau are also undergoing study in a computer programming course offered at RMIT, so we thought the best course of action is to split them up to distribute their skills among the group, With Angadh being the lead developer in the game development with Matthew.
    This leaves Beau as the lead developer to assist Kieran in changing and adapting the website to feature the new assessment content. As the project idea is based on Maddison’s original idea The application user interface will be under her supervision with Cameron. 
</p>

<p>
    All members of the team will be working within the testing sector as we are keeping all testing in-house at this early stage. This is not only due to privacy concerns but will also ensure that all members get a hands-on experience with each aspect of the criteria.
    In the case of an unforeseen circumstance where a team member is unable to complete their task, another member will be able to step in and be up to date. 
</p>

<h3><strong>Scope and Limits</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Scope Overview</strong></h4>
<p>
    The overall scope for our product is determined by the length of the assessment and our individual knowledges and skills, as we’re all learning new aspects of development for this project.
</p>

<p>
    In general, we plan to have an engaging, usable, and lightly informative proof of concept to deliver. Many features outlined in the Product Overview will be absent due to time and ability constraints, however the idea will be clear, and the intent and possibilities will be visible.
</p>

</ul>

<h4><strong>Limits and Associated Issues</strong></h4>
<p>
    This section covers some of the limits and issues we may reach within our scope and throughout development. 
</p>
<h5><strong>Software Limits</strong></h5>
<p>
    Our chosen software for the app (Figma) is a prototyping tool, and as such is lacking some basic development functions we would have liked.
    These include the ability for a user to type and interact with certain elements. 
</p>
<p>
    The website has been programmed without the use of a design tool such as Jekyl or Wordpress. This has presented the limitations of the programmers’ knowledge and ability, but overall has created a more personal website that has provided learning experiences and still looks great. 
</p>

<h5><strong>Communication Limits</strong></h5>
<p>
    Communication has been difficult being in a remote team. Thus far this has not proved to be as limiting as expected, however it’s still limited to peoples’ personal schedules as we’re not all together for a working day. 
</p>


<h3><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h3>
<p>
    What software or other tools are required by the project? Are there any software licenses needed? Is there any hardware
    needed (beyond a standard laptop or something similar)? This needs to be precise (e.g. Windows Movie Maker Version 45.3)
    but needn't be long. You should also include a brief description of any prior experience any group members have had with the
    tools and technologies you list. There is no minimum length for this. It is important to be as precise as possible, but descriptions
    of the tools are not needed here    
</p>

<h3><strong>Testing</strong></h3>
<p>
    How will your test your project? How will you know when you have succeeded? Testing is not something that you should leave
    until the very end; often it is far more useful to have a quick and dirty “mock up" of a project and then do some (limited)
    testing, to and out whether you are building the right product. If your project involves user testing, you should describe in your
    plan how you will find the test users, approximately what number of people you will need, and what background (if any) is
    required. At least one paragraph is expected here.   
</p>

<h3><strong>Timeframe</strong></h3>
<p>
    Another difficult aspect of project planning is knowing how much time to allow. You will have something like 36 hours per
    person for this assignment. In order to develop a plan for further work beyond the end of this course, let us assume that you
    will have an extra 10 hours per week per person for 10 weeks in addition to this time in order to develop your project. This
    means that you will have six weeks (Weeks 7 to 12) of the semester to work on your assignment, with a further 10 weeks after
    that. This means that your plan will be for a total of 15 weeks, with the first 6 being on this assignment.
    You will clearly not have the extra 10 weeks to work on the project; this is intended to give you a feeling for how much you
    would be able to achieve in that time. This means that the first 6 weeks of your timeline will end up being your actually
    progress on this project, with the remaining 10 weeks being your plan for the next stages.
    This should be presented in the form of a table, with one row for each week, specifying as best you can the work for each
    person for each week. This means that the first six rows of the table will describe your progress so far, and the remaining 10
    your best guess at how the remaining time would work.
    This will no doubt change as you work on your assignment, as it will give you a more precise idea about how long it will take to
    get things done. This is not an unchangeable contract for exactly how things will work; that is unrealistic for just about any
    project. The idea is to get you thinking about how exactly your time should be allocated to the various tasks involved. It is a
    good idea to have a milestone (i.e. a specific outcome) for each week of the project. This may include getting familiar with
    tools, or reading up on a particular technique or technology. You should also include time for writing up the final report and 
    Page 7 of 12
    any other documentation. Writing reports always takes longer than you think, especially as you should expect to re-write any
    piece of writing that you do at least three or four times.    
</p>

<h3><strong>Risks</strong></h3>
<p>
    What risks can you identify for your project? There will always be some generic risks (such as computers breaking down the
    night before a deadline, health and family issues, and institutional changes). Do not include generic risks such as these. The
    idea is to be as specific as you can to your project. For example, if your topic is to develop a game, there may be a risk that the
    software you choose to work with may be very difficult to learn, poorly documented, or not turn out to have the features that
    it claims it has. These properties are often only discovered once you have started working with the software, and so unless you
    have had lots of experience with the particular tool, there is always a risk that it may not work as well as you believe it should,
    no matter how much prior research you do. Similar comments apply to hardware.    
</p>

<h3><strong>Group Processes and Communications</strong></h3>
<p>
    Communication between group members is arguably the most important aspect of your project. Past experience has shown
    that communication breakdowns between group members is the most common cause of project failures, so it is vital that you
    specify at the outset the means and expected frequency of communication between group members. How will your group
    communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or
    Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ... ?? What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to
    communications? You should expect contact between group members at least twice a week. You can always make contact
    more often if you wish, but you do need to know what minimum frequency is expected from all members of your group. At
    least one paragraph is expected here.
