<h5><strong> Overview</strong></h5>

<h6><strong>Topic</strong></h6>
<p>
    ‘This IT project will be to educate children and families in understanding how to recycle, but we want to design it in the easiest possible way for families to get all the information they need in one app.
    Finding research on how to recycle can be daunting and difficult to find online, our app will do this for the user, so all the information you need will be in one place instead of having to do long hours of research on many different websites to achieve an understanding how to recycle.’ (IT MOB 2022)
</p>

<p>
    The kid's section has been designed for children, so they are able to learn in an easy, simple to understand language. A game has also been added for the benefits of children to play and learn as they will be more interested in learning if it is appealing and fun to them.
    The IT MOB have approached developing the app this way to keep children engaged and prompt an early beginning in the best practices to recycle, so that when they become adults it will be second nature to them.
</p>

<p>
    The big benefit the IT MOB is hoping to achieve with the Recyclobility App is lowering landfill percentage, encouraging people to recycle items so environmental areas and water ways are landfill free, along with helping these places to stay beautiful and clean.
    This is a long-term goal, but the benefits we are hoping to see happen for the planet and our app users by recycling is:
    <ul>
        <li>May save you money </li>
        <li>Decreases pollution and reduce greenhouse gases </li>
        <li>Save landfill space </li>
        <li>Reduction in energy consumption </li>
        <li>Conserve natural resources (KS environmental group, 2015) </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6><strong>Motivation</strong></h6>
<p>
    This app is going to be exciting and useful for a multitude of reasons. Having all the following information in one app will allow the user to go to one section and find out all the information they need on recycling. (IT MOB 2022)  
</p>

<p>
    Society is always trying to save time in our busy lives but taking care of our beautiful land is time consuming and no-one seems to have the time to do it.
    So, what better way to get everyone involved but by cutting down the time it takes to learn to recycle with having all the information in a fun and easy to use app.
    How this fits in to the current IT trends is by creating a solution to a problem that will make our lives easier which many technological devices are based on these days.
</p>

<p>
    Why is it so interesting? As humans we all crave freedom, beautiful views, and spaces to relax. How will society have this if our beautiful planet is over filled with pollution and landfill.
    What if climate change continues its current trend and we are unable to enjoy the beautiful weather.
    How many of you look forward to that holiday you booked on pristine beaches or near roaring forests. Recycling will help us enjoy these things for longer.
</p>

<h6><strong>Landscape</strong></h6>
<p>
    Previously in assessment one (Davis 2021) apps were cross checked with the project idea, this information still stands.
    Development of this app has all the sources a user needs to understand recycling and the benefits of what it does for our planet. There is an education area for the user to learn about the effects of landfill and most importantly, all the key areas are in one place saving hours of research for the user. 
    It also has a kid friendly area for easy-to-understand information regarding recycling, and a game for children to learn whilst having fun.
    Most of the apps available today are lacking in these areas and only provide information on which bin to use and drop off recycling stations near you. This project is leading towards a motivating and educational theme.
</p>

                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Detailed Description</strong></h5>

<h6><strong>Aims</strong></h6>
<p>
    Within this Project, there are key elements at the forefront of the idea as well and some smaller yet essential elements.
    The main objective for the IT Mob is to deliver critical information about what to recycle and just as important, what not to recycle, to people of all ages.
    This being the team’s main objective the next step is to provide a means to achieve this, the following questions were asked:  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How can we get this information across to people? </li>
    <li>hy would the younger/older generation open the information? </li>
    <li>Can we make recycling simpler in a specific local area?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the questions had been asked, the team started working on the answers. This idea can become a reality firstly through the use of an application.
    This application will have a simple layout containing all the relevant information about general recycling that can be done at home.
    The first step in this plan will be to conduct extensive research into the structure of recycling, due to the limited time available, this research will be done for one state in Australia.
    With further time given, more states will be included. Future development of this Application will involve a geotagged system where the users will be given the correct information based on where they are at the point of time the app is opened.
</p>
<p>
    A big issue that has been raised is why would people of all ages want to download our application.
    To address this concern, we came up with the idea of a mobile game designed to educate users through gameplay, as this has proven successful in many formats.
    Inside the game, the user will run down a road collecting recyclables gaining points. The user will lose a life when they try and collect a piece of rubbish that is non-recyclable. 
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the aim of this project is to create a platform on which information is easily and simply identifiable.
    This will be achieved through two main aspects, a mobile application, and a game. The teams first step will be in-depth research of the topic, then designing the application.
    After this will be the production of a game designed to educate the part of the population that are visual, tactile learners. If time allows the team will look further into integrating systems into the app that allow location-specific information easier to gather.
</p>

                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></h5>
<p>
    It all began with an idea and a passion.
</p>

<p>
    This project was born by the need to develop a project idea for a university assessment which then sparked a passion for the Recycobility App. Maddison enjoys the natural places on this beautiful earth and wanted to keep them as beautiful as possible, which was the inspiration behind the idea for an app which will contain everything you need to be able to learn how to recycle and help us keep this world beautiful by reversing the effects of landfill, the app is to encourage more people in society help do just that by learning how to recycle in an quick and easy way.
</p>
<p>
    This project led to a team effort and after discussing all the wonderful project ideas each member of the team had, everybody felt that a recycling app was the best one to target. After coming together and beginning to develop more ideas for the app, our group the IT Mob was born.
</p>
<p>
    Beginning to explore the best information to use in the app, it was decided when learning about recycling that it is best to know the reasons behind doing it? How to do it? The effects if we don’t do it, and the benefits from it. A single person can spend hours online trying to find this information on the web going from site to site. So, it made sense to pull the most important points of recycling and putting in information that would draw the user into the app. The information pulled is useful for people of all ages. If the app can get children involved in recycling at a young age it has the potential to become second nature to them throughout their life.  
</p>
<p>
    So, the brainstorm began, what were the most important parts to this app, this lead the team to the following page ideal for the app. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Home Page: </b>page was designed to explain why it is important to recycle, the app needs to draw the consumer in with information to give them a passion toward recycling as much as the IT MOB did. So, when beginning to search on the web the focus points were why is it so important to recycle, who was doing it and how does it benefit our planet, hoping this would encourage others to want to get involved. A personal and passionate information section was also added into this area on how the IT MOB felt about recycling.</li>
    <li><b>Recycling tips: </b>information was sourced for this page to give users tips on how to know if an item is recyclable, things to do before recycling and tips on common mistake made when recycling. </li>
    <li><b>Charts and Guides: </b>Printable charts and guides were found on the web that help the user have something to use at home to refer to when learning to recycle. A list of recyclable items and a basis printable chart on guidelines of which items can go into which bin. You can find the charts by just clicking on the pictures.</li>
    <li><b>Composting: </b>A list of instructions were written up by member Maddison Davis on how to compost in your own home, this reduces home food waste from going to landfill, and the user can also use it on their own garden therefore recycling their waste.</li>
    <li><b>Landfill:</b>In this page, information was sourced about what landfill is doing to the planet, how it effects the environment, and statistics on the raise in landfill over the years. A photo was also included of all the landfills that are in Australia.</li>
    <li><b>Climate Change: </b>Information about the hazards landfill creates such as toxins, leachate and greenhouse gases were explored in this area. Information on what these substances do within landfill and how it affects our planet have been referenced within this page.</li>
    <li><b>Community Action: </b>This page will have community involvement opportunities you could get involved with helping clean up our planet and support organisations that adhere to reuse and recycle policies.</li>
    <li><b>Kids Page: </b> A link to the game attached to this page, with easy to understand language on recycling, climate change, and landfill topics for children to read. This is so adults could learn in more depth, but children had a write up to be able to learn at their level.</li>
    <li><b>Which Bin: </b>A search bar and data base section is to be applied here, there is more work needed to be done on our prototype section, thus this will be reflected in future updates. Once fub Users should be able to search all types of rubbish which will appear in the highlighted colour of which bin the item belongs in with a description on steps to take before putting it in the bin.</li>
</ul>

<h6><strong>Interface:</strong></h6>
<p>
    So, after gathering the following information, designing the app was next. Comparisons were done on which website or prototype tool should be used. Firstly, we researched the pros and cons of different tools available on the internet, and after deciding what tool was suitable for our needs, we decided to use Figma. This was due to it tutorial videos available, click and drag feather, and available design resources. Figma is also compatible with Bravo Studio and Bravo Vision which allows your prototype design in Figma to be uploaded into an app on IOS or Google play. When using Figma and Bravo it is ideal to learn them both at the same time, as there is a certain way you must use Figma with labelling frame, coding feature to tell Bravo what you would like the frame to do for your app to be visible and working correctly. 
</p>
<p>
    A video meeting was held in Microsoft teams so the team could discuss and choose how the app was going to look, we spoke about layout, colour theme, and designing a children’s game. Once we had everybody’s thoughts, Maddison and Cameron were allocated to designing the interface. 
</p>
<p>
    Frames were created in Figma with labelling of what they would become e.g., climate change, landfill etc. Features like shapes, prototypes, and plugins (available icons, pictures that could be downloaded to use within Figma) were used to start designing. Two people can be in Figma at the same time, so you can collaborate as a team and see each other work to match your design.
</p>
<p>
    Testing the interface was done through Bravo Vision, this is available from google play or the app store which allows you to test the designed prototype on a mobile device. This allows the creator to see what the app will look like once it is uploaded to IOS or Google play, you can also test any added features you may be using. Due to our prototype still being incomplete, the prototype has been added to Figma community for outside team members to view through the URL link <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1076321804637916769?preview=fullscreen">Figma App Preview</a>
</p>

<h6><strong>Game:</strong></h6>
<p>
    At this point the idea of a children’s game within the app was decided. This was done to help children learn the difference between recyclable and non-recyclable materials through an interactive game. Brainstorming was done to decide how the game was going to be designed, what style of game we wished to develop, and what game development tool to use. We used the same method of pros and cons to differentiate between the tools to make this choice.
</p>
<p>
    Mathew and Angadh were assigned to create a deliverable game using sources available for free on the internet. Many different game development software’s were explored in the first week such as Construct 3, Unity 3D and Game Maker Studio.
</p>
<p>
    Angadh used Construct 3 to start developing a basic game but found there were many limitations that had to be unlocked with paid subscriptions. Mathew explored Unity 3D but was not able to progress far as tutorials for the style game we wanted were not available. Eventually after exploring various features a Software called Build Box 3 was chosen due to its ease of use and various free features which allowed for the game to be shaped in the way the development team wanted.
</p>
<p>
    After trialling various features in Build Box 3, Angadh and Mathew settled on a final game concept in early week 2, The idea was aimed at young adults and children with the goal to teach basic knowledge on recyclable items through a fun, visual, and interactive experience. A garbage collection style game which has recyclable items that can be picked up to gain points and non-recyclable items that end the game when collected was settled on and put into development.
</p>
<p>
    Build Box 3 allowed for images to be easily imported as objects, this allowed for easily identifiable, everyday items to be into the game such as pizza boxes, Australian Dairy milk cartoons, and aluminium cans. These objects are easily recognisable by children and adults alike and are basic items that can be recycled. Everyday non-recyclable items were also added such as chicken drumsticks, apples, and gummy bears which were already available on Build Box 3.
</p>
<p>
    Various tutorials on YouTube and in Build Box 3 were followed to create features that functioned the way we intended. The substantial number of online sources for these tutorials made it easy to develop the game throughout the project. Build Box has a testing feature which allows for constant testing through all stages of game development. After configuring Game mechanics, it was time to start adding cosmetic touches such as buildings, cars, and props for visual aesthetics which are all available for free on Build Box 3.
</p>
<p>
    Mathew designed the Start screen and Ending screen UI (User Interface) based on our recycling theme, while Angadh configured the mechanics of the game. All functions on build box 3 are drag and drop which made this easy so minimum to no coding was required. A basic template was copied from tutorials available on Build Box 3 and heavily altered to suit our concept. After all major work was done such as UI design and game configuration, minor touch ups were done by both Mathew and Angadh like scaling objects and small code errors before the final delivery of the Recycling Game.
</p>

                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Communication Tools:</strong></h5>
<p>
    Our main communication tool for this project was Microsoft Teams. Video meetings were held twice a week and updates were given on the progress of the interface and game development process. In MS teams there is a chat option where team members can leave questions and concerns daily so we did not have to wait until the end of the week for an answer. Poll options was used for voting needs, e.g., naming the app which led us to the name ‘Recyclobility.’
</p>
<p>
    When using Figma there is a comment option, where you were able to leave comments on certain parts of the development so other members of the team could read your thoughts on a particular area. This was handy in the way of leaving comments for your team members to check on something that may not be working or reminding yourself to come back later to update a section of work.
</p>

<h6><strong>Status of Process with Development:</strong></h6>
<p>
    The app is only designed as far as a prototype and an idea and there is much more that could be added in towards the app. More research done on the which bin page to have a larger database and sectioned into the local council area, state, or territory your rubbish applies to. Due to the assessment deadline the app was unable to be published as it is not a fully functioning app.
</p>

<h6><strong>Conclusion</strong></h6>
<p>
    The Recyclobility app/game it will make learning to recycle easier, fun, and simple which will encourage more users to join in with helping the planet by recycling and lowering landfill wastage. Children will begin to learn from a younger age making them more skilled in recycling when they reach adulthood. With the educational push on the app, users will develop a better understanding and passion toward helping our planet.

                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Roles</strong></h5>
<p>
    The IT mob is a diverse group with different strengths to capitalise on. Within this team, all the members have naturally adapted to their roles with ease. The leader of the group, Kieran, was chosen as he has a keen eye for detail, making him a great decision-maker.
    Within the group, Angadh and Beau are also undergoing study in a computer programming course offered at RMIT, so we thought the best course of action is to split them up to distribute their skills among the group, With Angadh being the lead developer in the game development with Matthew.
    This leaves Beau as the lead developer to assist Kieran in changing and adapting the website to feature the new assessment content. As the project idea is based on Maddison’s original idea The application user interface will be under her supervision with Cameron. 
</p>

<p>
    All members of the team will be working within the testing sector as we are keeping all testing in-house at this early stage. This is not only due to privacy concerns but will also ensure that all members get a hands-on experience with each aspect of the criteria.
    In the case of an unforeseen circumstance where a team member is unable to complete their task, another member will be able to step in and be up to date. 
</p>

                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Scope and Limits</strong></h5>

</ul>

<h6><strong>Limits and Associated Issues</strong></h6>
<p>
    This section covers some of the limits and issues we may reach within our scope and throughout development. 
</p>
<h6><strong>Software Limits</strong></h6>
<p>
    Our chosen software for the app (Figma) is a prototyping tool, and as such is lacking some basic development functions we would have liked.
    These include the ability for a user to type and interact with certain elements. 
</p>
<p>
    The website has been programmed without the use of a design tool such as Jekyl or Wordpress. This has presented the limitations of the programmers’ knowledge and ability, but overall has created a more personal website that has provided learning experiences and still looks great. 
</p>

<h6><strong>Communication Limits</strong></h6>
<p>
    Communication has been difficult being in a remote team. Thus far this has not proved to be as limiting as expected, however it’s still limited to peoples’ personal schedules as we’re not all together for a working day. 
</p>


                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Figma.exe 108.1.0.0 – Figma was used to develop the user interface as it was an easy-to-use collaborative tool designed to create applications for mobile phones. It also has a feature to publish the prototype to an online community for others to view.</li>
    <li>Buildbox 3.4.6 – Buildbox was used to develop the game as it contained all the features we wanted to include in the game without requiring payment. Buildbox allowed us to export the game in multiple different formats to allow easy sharing between team members, along with a way to share our game with the markers.</li>
    <li>Bravo Vision 1.7.6 - Bravo Vision is a downloadable application that allowed us to test our prototype user interface on a mobile device. This software would show errors in the application that could not be seen when testing through an internet browser. This allowed us to create a more robust prototype.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bravostudio.app/">Bravo Studio</a>  - Bravo Studio was used for tutorials on how to link our Figma project with Bravo Vision.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code v1.64 – Visual Studio Code was used for the coding of the website. Visual Studio Code allowed for easier coding due to its multitude of features which included the ability to push and pull from GitHub which allowed for a more streamlined process.</li>
    <li>GitHub, Inc. 2.9.9.0 – GitHub was used to create our repository for our website. This site allowed us to fork our repository from our assessment 2 and work on it in a collaborative way. GitHub includes source control which keeps track of all changes to the repository through git commits.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> - The GitHub website allowed us to publish or repository as a public web page for people to see. This was also be used for testing purposes with uploading and distributing the game through a webpage.</li>
    <li>Microsoft Teams 1.10.84.0 – Microsoft Teams was allocated to us by the assessment as the way to communicate. Teams has many features such as video conference calls, recording and transcribing calls, file sharing, and task planning. These features gave us the ability to work as a cohesive team while keeping the majority of our work in one place that could be accessed by anyone in the team at a time of their choosing.</li>
</ul>

                                                                                                        <h5><strong>Testing</strong></h5>
<h6><strong>Interface Testing:</strong></h6>
<p>
    During the development of the interface for the Recyclobility App, the testing method was done through Figma’s presentation view. This brings out the design’s mainframe along with any other frames connected to it, so the design can be tested by touching the area point which has features attached to it. To ensure our app would work on a mobile device we used Bravo Studios. A copy file was downloaded on to Bravo Studios, which can then be brought up on the app Bravo Vision, which can be downloaded onto mobile devices. This brings the design up on your mobile device which allows the features created using Figma to be tested. Bravo Studios use notifications when an error has occurred so that it can be adjusted and fixed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Testing out uploading the app will be done through bravo studio. Due to needing to apply for publication, exporting the code (which had a cost to be able to successful do this) or coding the entire app from scratch ourselves we were unable to get our interface into application format. In order to know if markers would be able to have access to our interface design the URL was sent to another student to see if they were able to gain access into our design with no complications. This was unsuccessful; however, it was possible to upload the prototype into the Figma community for outside team members to view our work which generated a public a URL.
</p>

<h6><strong>Game Design:</strong></h6>
<p>
    The game has been designed and will be released to the team to test and give feedback. The team can sign up to Buildbox 3 and download the games file to be able to test the created game.
</p>
<p>
    Testing is done through Buildbox 3 in the preview mode, this brings the game up for the creator to play the game and ensure all the features are working which have been put into place. The game will come up in a frame size to mobile device so you can see how the background design looks to a potential player. The team was able to successfully upload a compressed folder of the game to GitHub which contained an Exe that could be tested on a computer without the need to create and download a Buildbox account. This folder is available for download from our website, and the user may need to add exceptions into their anti-virus software to be able to run the program.

<h6><strong>Communication</strong></h6>
<p>
    Communication among our team was easily established due to each members willingness, and our course being delivered online. Specific communication tools and processes were laid out for us and were included in the information of all our assignments.
    This made the platform and communication amount automatically and facilitated a smooth transition into groupwork.
</p>

<h6><strong>Technologies and Meetings</strong></h6>
<p>
    As required, we have been using Microsoft Teams for all group communications. This tool allows us to have formal/informal discussions, organise members tasks, record and transcribe meetings, and organise assignment documents into a centralised and accessible location.
</p>

<p>
    We knew we needed to have a minimum of two meetings per week and put the times that we conducted these meetings to a vote. There were not any issues regarding the results, and so far, each member has shown up to every meeting they can.
    Our meetings generally run for an hour and cover all facets of the current project, from progress updates from each team/member as well as concerns and assistance from each team/member.
</p>

<h6><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></h6>
<p>
    Thus far our finalised group has not had any conflicts, non-communicators, or any other inter-personal issues. However, initially we had two members who ended up leaving the group, and we had to follow some resolution pathways with those members.
</p>

<p>
    In our initial meetings for A2 we had created a rough timeline and an even division of tasks to each member, one member of our group did not agree with the tasks set and wanted to take on more/all the work.
    The resolution was to explain that the tasks were divided equally, and it would be unfair for him to take on the amount he wanted, as well as some members offering to swap tasks that the team member wanted.
    These attempts at resolving the issue went unanswered and unfortunately the member left the group.
</p>

<p>
    Following this we received another member that we were not able to communicate with. Our avenues to handle this were initially to attempt to reach the member on Microsoft Teams, as they had joined the IT Mob.
    Following the no response, we attempted to reach the member through canvas, and then their student email. Finally, we contacted our teacher Umera to seek advice about the situation, and the student eventually left our group.
</p>

<p>
    Since these events, we have had no other issues, however we have come up with some processes surrounding future communication issues should they arise. Our weekly meetings are on Mondays and Fridays, and we have agreed to give people a grace period of between meetings to respond.
    If no response is received, we will try to reach them through canvas/student email. If there is still no response before the next meeting, then we will divide up their assignment sections so work can be completed and we will contact Umera for advice and assistance.
