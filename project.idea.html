        Project Idea

    </h1>

<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>This IT project will be to educate children and families in understanding how to recycle, but we want to design it in the easiest possible way for families to get all the information they need in one app. Finding research on how to recycle can be daunting and difficult to find online our app will do this for the user, so all the information you need will be in one place instead of having to do long hours of research on many different websites to achieve an understanding how to recycle.</p>

<h1><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>
<p>This app is going to be exciting and useful for many different reasons, having all the following information in one app will allow the user to go to one section and find all the information they need on recycling. The team will do research and source the following information for the app.</p>
<ul>
   <li>How does not recycling affect us. Understanding this will make the world aware of why recycling is so important and why people should learn more.</li> 
   <li>The importance of recycling. Does society know the importance of recycling? If society understands more about recycling, they will develop a passion for doing it.  This will encourage users to be more invested in learning more and getting the app more screen time. Other apps are lacking in this information.</li>
   <li>Climate change and landfills education.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above is going to draw in users as they will now understand why this app is good to use, how users will be bettering the earth and our atmosphere by using the app once designed. In the beginning </p>

<h1><strong>Description</strong></h1>
<p>The following subjects will be put on the app with their own access points, with the following information in them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Climate change: this section will have definitions of what it is, what causes it, and how recycling will affect it positively.</li>
    <li>Landfills: definition of what landfill is, what landfill does to our planet, what recycling does to benefit our landfills and earth. With real-life images of landfill sites. </li>
    <li>Recycling Tips: Resources for recycling tips. For example,<ol><li>Don’t put recycling in plastic bags</li>
        <li>Remove all food and liquid from containers</li>
        <li>Lids and labels can stay on</li>
        <li>Give plastic items the ‘scrunch test’</li>
        <li>Give cardboard items the ‘tear test’</li>
        <li>Ignore the plastics identification number. (City of Sydney, n.d)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>What can go into your yellow bin: City of Darwin, Whichbin.sa.gov.au, City of Monash, City of Hobert, City of South Perth, City of Sydney, Queensland Government these websites also have recycling detail and council contact details this could help with getting the resource information from the professionals for correct recycling. Which then can be used to categories and have a search bar for items to be easily found.</li>
    <li>What can go in the green bins: same as above.</li>
    <li>How to compost: Instruction on how to compost. Written by Maddison Davis.</li><ol>
        <li>Get a lidded plastic bin, select a safe place in the backyard to keep it. To avoid rodents, you can bury the bottom part of your bin.</li>
        <li>Fill your compost bin with dry items e.g., paper, cardboard, green items e.g., grass, leaves, and food scraps. You will need more dry items than green.</li>
        <li>Compost will need to be watered if dry.</li>
        <li>Turn compost over every now and then and keep adding items until the compost is full enough to use.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>	Recycling Guides: this section is a chart or easy-to-read diagrams for children to read to learn how to recycle. It will be printable so parents can print them out and put them on the fridge. Once getting the resource of what people can and can’t recycle, it will be possible to use Canva to design and build our own. We can source feedback from an early childhood employee to ensure our charts are kid-friendly and helpful.</li>
    <li>	To help parents with the mundane task of rubbish this application will also include a reward system for kids, when a certain item has been but into the recycle bin or compost a star value or virtual coin will be given as a reward, this gives children am incentive to get involved while also gaining knowledge in the practice of recycling. </li>
</ul>
<p>Application Layout</p>
<p>The application layout will start with.</p>
<ul>
    <li>	The application layout will start with a drop-down menu asking what you are recycling, with multiple options; once selected, the user will proceed with the following question: Is the item inside a plastic bag? If selected yes, the app will ask to discard the plastic bag; if no has been chosen, it will proceed to Question 3, which will then ask if the item is free from food or liquids; if yes, it will ask if the product is plastic or cardboard, then that will define whether a scrunch test or tear test is necessary with a tutorial on these tests, guiding the user through the process to make a non-recyclable item, a recyclable. To which on the final screen, there will be advice on the possibilities for the product, whether it is a yellow bin, red bin, personal compost, or if there is a local facility close to the user’s current location. With links to their own council’s policy and procedures regarding recycling.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of the above, the app should also be appealing to the eye, especially for kids: so bright colours, easy simple language, easy to navigate, and pictures for visual learning. </p>
