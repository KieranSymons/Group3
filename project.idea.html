<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>This IT project will be to educate children and families in understanding how to recycle, but we want to design it in the easiest possible way for families to get all the information they need in one app. Finding research on how to recycle can be daunting and difficult to find online our app will do this for the user, so all the information you need will be in one place instead of having to do long hours of research on many different websites to achieve an understanding how to recycle.</p>

<h1><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>
<p>This app is going to be exciting and useful for many different reasons, having all the following information in one app will allow the user to go to one section and find all the information they need on recycling. The team will do research and source the following information for the app.</p>
<ul>
   <li>How does not recycling affect us. Understanding this will make the world aware of why recycling is so important and why people should learn more.</li> 
   <li>The importance of recycling. Does society know the importance of recycling? If society understands more about recycling, they will develop a passion for doing it.  This will encourage users to be more invested in learning more and getting the app more screen time. Other apps are lacking in this information.</li>
   <li>Climate change and landfills education.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above is going to draw in users as they will now understand why this app is good to use, how users will be bettering the earth and our atmosphere by using the app once designed. In the beginning </p>

<h1><strong>Description</strong></h1>
<p>The following subjects will be put on the app with their own access points, with the following information in them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Climate change: this section will have definitions of what it is, what causes it, and how recycling will affect it positively.</li>
    <li>Landfills: definition of what landfill is, what landfill does to our planet, what recycling does to benefit our landfills and earth. With real-life images of landfill sites. </li>
    <li>Recycling Tips: Resources for recycling tips. For example,</li></ul>
    <ol><li>Don’t put recycling in plastic bags</li>
        <li>Remove all food and liquid from containers</li>
        <li>Lids and labels can stay on</li>
        <li>Give plastic items the ‘scrunch test’</li>
        <li>Give cardboard items the ‘tear test’</li>
        <li>Ignore the plastics identification number. (City of Sydney, n.d)</li>
    </ol>
